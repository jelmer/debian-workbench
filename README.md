debian-analyzer
===============

This rust crate provides a set of tools to analyze Debian packages and
make changes to them.

It is designed to be used as part of a larger toolchain for making
changes to Debian packages. One of the key users of it
is the [Debian Codemods](https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/debian-codemods)
project, which uses it to make changes to Debian packages in a
consistent and automated way.
